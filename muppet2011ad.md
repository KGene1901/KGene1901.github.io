#Interest of content

##Excellent

The content of two of the pages is extracted from articles from the NewScientist and the BBC. Whilst the content of these is interesting, I'm not sure I can award
it given that it was not authored by you. However, posts 2 and 4 appear to have original content that is engaging and interesting, so I'll still give the section a good mark.

#Consistency and quality of visual presentation

##Perfect

Real effort has been put into the appearance of this website. Bootstrap classes for mastheads, headers and navbars have been used to great effect, creating a visually appealing website. The use of shared CSS files has ensured that elements across all pages are consistent, and most html elements are carried across pages for consistency. The website is overall highly appealing and perfectly consistency.

#Quality of written presentation

##Exemplary

Besides a few typos here and there, there are no major errors with spelling or grammar. The text is also formatted in such a way that it is easy to read and not an overwhelming wall of text.

#Validity of HTML

##Perfect

There are no errors in the HTML that VSCode can spot, nor are there any indications of broken HTML in how the page is rendered. As far as I can tell, the HTML is perfectly valid throughout.

#Evidence of collaboration

##Excellent

* Git blame indicates that author info was not written by the author of each page, indicating successfull collaboration in working on the same files.
* Contributions from members do not seem to be perfectly balanced (as all things should be). Ignoring the 70k additions made by one person (presumably they copied in the JS and CSS from bootstrap), there is one contributor with only 8 additions, whereas KGene1901 and awphi have 433 and 82, respectively. 
* The page was not completed at the last minute, with the vast majority of commits occurring before the end of the weekend (with some final tweaking just before).
