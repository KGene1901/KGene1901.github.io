## Consistency and quality of visual presentation
From the home page to everyone's individual pages, a constant style of representing your pages can be seen. I do feel like you could have inserted more images to enhance the visual presentation.
Mark: Very Good

## Quality of written presentation:
The content of your page includes valid points about the application of computing in the education field in today's world. However, I did come across a spelling error in your first sub-heading. The content does cover one of the major questions about why we should be using computers in the first place and it was well thought-out. The references that you have included point to the right sections. Love how you included the interesting fact at the bottom of your page!
Mark: Outstanding

## Validity of HTML
You have utilised HTML well in the process of developing you web pages, however, you/your team has used alot more of JavaScript.
Mark: Very Good

## Evidence of Collaboration:
To begin with, it does not seem like your project was a last minute thing. It was done spaced-out during the one week that we got. You have interacted well with your peers and have wriiten another member's 'About the Author' section.
Mark: Perfect
