          <p>Cybersecurity is a practice of ensuring safe and protected network access and traffic for all web users from malicious digital acts. These acts are in the form of cyberattacks <em>ie</em> hacking, phishing and pharming which can result in a violation of personal data safety and huge financial losses of a business. There are various cybersecurity firms active today (for example <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en_uk/index.html" target="_blank">Cisco</a> and <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-gb/index.html" target="_blank">McAfee</a>) developing and constantly improving network security by creating and implementing new software and algorithms to analyse, detect and remove potential network security risk or unauthorised net access.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Ways To Strengthen Cybersecurity</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><h4>
            Biometric Systems
            </li></h4>
              The adoption of biometrics, especially behavioral biometrics, in various indurstries such as automotive and banking has been growing significantly for the past few years. This is likely due to its effectiveness and efficiency in detetcting unusual movements and responses of a user in real time when put into effect. <u><a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/next-generation-biometric-technologies-market-697.html" target="_blank">Click here</a></u> to take a look at the biometric system market survey and prediction done by MarketsandMarkets.
            <li><h4>
            Backing Up Data 
            </li></h4>
              As typical as it may sound, many users today still lack good practice of this method of protecting data in their devices or networks. Backups have to be done frequently and it is also advised that the data stored should be securely encrypted to prevent exploitation by malware attacks. <u><a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_backup_options.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a></u> to view a document detailing backup methods by the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team. 
            <li><h4>
            Be Wary of Phishing
            </li></h4>
              Phishing is the malicious act of scamming users or consumers via fake emails or phone calls to gain confidential/personal information. A good cybersecurity practice to combat this is to always ensure that unknown phone calls and emails are filtered out or blacklisted; in businesses, strict cybersecurity policies can be enforced to ensure employees are educated and made aware of the risks of phishing. <u><a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2019-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">Verizon's 2019 Data Breach Report</a></u> illustrates the percentage drop on the amount of clicks on phishing links of its users and employees through a sanctioned phishing exercise.
