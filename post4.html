          <p>Computers today are an inseparable part of various fields and our day to day life. They have revolutionised many industries through the use of data, automation, communication and other various different methods; but one of the most important application of computers to me has been in the field of education. Technological advancement in computing has made computers more and more accessible, with almost 56% of the global population, a continuously growing number having access to the internet. Computers have made a meaningful impact in distant learning, sharing resources and they have proven themselves to be a brilliant teaching and learning aid in all stages of education.</p>

          <h2>Applications of using computers in eduction.</h2>
          <p>Advancements in data processing and storage technologies, communication technologies and development of web technologies have various applications in the teaching and learning process. The advantages of computers in education primarily include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Creating and storing resources digitally</li>
            <li>Quick data processing, which has applications in interactive tutorials, data visualisation, personalised learning etc. </li>
            <li>Audio-visual aid in teaching</li>
            <li>Better presentation of information using animation, presentation software etc.</li>
            <li>Access to the internet which has many applications in distant and self learning</li>
            <li>Quick communication with students, teachers and parents</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In a modern education system, students have access to information far beyond the scope of their syllabus which is made for learners on many different levels. The internet has fantastic resources, many of which are available for free, that overcome problems such as the stigma of asking for help when a student has a difficulty in understanding a certain material because it is too advance which makes the content inaccessible for them.</p>
          <h2>Why should we use computers in education?</h2>
          <p>Digital resources are also easier to create; more efficient to use, store and distribute and more sustainable compared to paper. All of this paired with better communication technologies is making getting help more accessible to students than ever before.</p>
          <p>Computers aid in teaching and learning. Their popularity in recent years has reduced the cost of manufacturing so that more people can afford them. Hardware such as touchscreen makes them more intuitive, e-ink tablets reduce the strain on user’s eyes while allowing access to digital resources. Digital note taking is one my favourite application of computers in education, digital notes are easy to create, organise, share and safeguard.</p>
          <p>Computers are the most valuable tool in distant learning. Physically distant locations have come closer due to Internet accessibility. There are many online educational courses available which can be tailored to a student based on their own pace and needs.</p>
          <p>In summary, the use of computers has made education more accessible and convenient for everyone. Emerging technologies such as VR and AR will continue to improve upon existing applications in education and also further undiscovered applications.</p>
