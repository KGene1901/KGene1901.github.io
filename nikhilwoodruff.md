## Interest of Content
### Mark: Excellent
The areas of computer science chosen are highly interesting, notably the 'Mind-Reading Exoskeleton' page. This could have been improved by slightly more detail in the sections. The 'interesting fact' section in the footer adds to the interest of the page and is a nice detail.

## Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
### Mark: Outstanding
Each page has a consistent style and the use of large image headers provides a very professional feel, as well as the impressive use of Bootstrap. The font and styling are all consistent and modern, and the date and author in the blog-style landing page are all very well done. Perhaps this could be improved by ensuring that all image headers are the same size. 

## Quality of Written Presentation
### Mark: Excellent
Overall, the written presentation is excellent, with levels of headers and clear structure. The consistency could be improved however, as while two of the pages ('Cybersecurity' and 'Importance of Education') contain good structured levels using headers and bullet-points, the other two don't have any headers but instead contain consecutive paragraphs from an external source.

## Validity of HTML
### Mark: Exemplary
All the HTML files are valid and work perfectly as expected. All references are in the correct section, for example JavaScript last.

## Evidence of Collaboration
### Mark: Excellent
There is an appropriately equal level of contribution from members, and the author information sections are written by different team members as required. The repository wasn't completed all at the last minute but shows a more even spread of activity. This could be improved in the future by using features such as GitHub issues or pull requests in order to avoid conflicts as the project becomes more complex.
